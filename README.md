# Url-Shortner Backend Challenge
In this challenge, we will create a URL Shortener API which can create and retrieve data from MongoDB.

Now we need to install packages. We will use

General Packages
* Express.js for API services
* Ejs for HTML markup with plain JS
* cors for CORS options
* helmet for basic security
* mongoose for MongoDB
* dotenv for env files
